# Creditdefaulters
Predict credit defaulters using Machine Learning techniques.


•	Built Predictive models to identify credit defaulters with utmost precision. 
•Attaining an impressive accuracy rate of 82.93% and generating an additional uplift of 1.8 million leveraging Random Forest Classifier.
•We have used Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) where we were able to use Random Forest Classifier to
reap the maximum profits.
